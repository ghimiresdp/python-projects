# Instruction for contributors

The project categories are named in alphabetical order so that the first folder
would be the easiest level and the last would be the hardest.

Each section contains respective resources, project solutions and requirements
so that we can easily add links to the markdown file. Example, If we want some
resources for the basic project, we can add them to the `res/` directory of the
`basic/` directory so that we can link them in the markdown file easily with
relative links.

Rules to contribute to projects:

- All solutions inside the project should satisfy module requirements, eg:
  `snake_case` so that we can import them easily with python `import` statement.

- We can not use offensive or racist words anywhere including variable names,
  example, and requirement specification.

- The solution we add should run on all operating systems. If not, We should
  mention everywhere that the program runs only in the specific operating
  system.


## Placeholders
Placeholders are not strict and we may use any name for them, but please try to
name them so that everyone who understands English can understand them properly.

We may use name of celebrities, or fictional characters of Sci-fi movies too
but we should make sure that those names should not impact sentiments of people
of any region, race, or gender.

Examples of some placeholders we may use in our project are as follows:

1. **Person**: `John Doe` `Darth Vader`, `Princes Leia`, `Iron Man`, etc.
2. **Place**: `High Street`, `Wakanda`, `Vulkan`, `Tatooine`, etc.
3. **Organization**: `Ace`, `Galactic Republic`, `Jedi`, `Enterprise`, etc.
4. **Domain Names** `example.com`, `starwars.com`, `johndoe.com`, etc.
